# Enemy Inbound

## Intro

I made this project for the Ludum Dare game jam in 2013 when I was 14. The project should be stored [here](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-27/?action=preview&uid=16998) on Ludum Dare's legacy website.

I recently found it stored away in my computer. All I could find was the jar file, but I put it through a decompiler and got the source code out. I organized it into a few classes with most of the code in draw.java. While I'm sure the reverse compiler did a number on the readability, I probably didn't organize it so well in middle school either.

The decompiled source code is in the src folder. EnemyInbound_v4.jar is the main jar executable.

## Gameplay

You are a square shooting squares at other squares. There's an in-game shop where you can upgrade your weapon or buy more health.
