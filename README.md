# Enemy Inbound

## Intro

Enemy Inbound is a game in Java that I made for the Ludum Dare game jam in 2013 when I was in 7th grade. Over the years, I lost the original source code, but I still had the .jar file. I ran it through a decompiler and put the result on Github. It's a dual stick shooter with a minimalist art style. You face an increasing number of enemies and can upgrade weapons and buy health.

The project used to be stored [here](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-27/?action=preview&uid=16998) on Ludum Dare's legacy website.

The decompiled source code is in the src folder. EnemyInbound_v4.jar is the main jar executable.

## Gameplay

You are a square shooting squares at other squares. There's an in-game shop where you can upgrade your weapon or buy more health.
